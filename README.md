# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Project Description
The **CPU Scheduling Simulator** is a tool designed to help visualize and understand different CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to input processes with attributes like arrival time, burst time, priority and time quantum, then simulates scheduling based on the selected algorithm. This project aims to provide insights into how different scheduling techniques impact process execution.

### Features:
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin.
- Dynamic input of process details.
- Gantt chart visualization for scheduling results.
- Calculates average waiting time and turnaround time.
- User-friendly graphical interface for ease of use.

## Usage
1. Launch the simulator.
2. Enter process details (Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority or Time Quantum).
3. Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown.
4. Click "Simulate" to run the scheduling algorithm.
5. View the generated Gantt chart and calculated metrics (waiting time, turnaround time).

## Future Improvements
- Improving Gantt chart accuracy.
- Adding more scheduling algorithms(like Multilevel Feedback Queue).
- Implementing real-time process execution simulation.
