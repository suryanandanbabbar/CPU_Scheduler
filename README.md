# FCFS

This branch implements the **First Come, First Served (FCFS)** CPU Scheduling Algorithm in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Graphical Input Panel**: Users can input process ID, arrival time, and burst time.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Currently supports **FCFS**.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization**: Displays the process execution order.
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes **Average Waiting Time** and **Average Turnaround Time**.

## Usage
1. **Launch the Application**.
2. **Enter Process Details**: Provide Process ID, Arrival Time, and Burst Time.
3. **Select FCFS Algorithm** (default).
4. **Click Simulate** to generate the Gantt Chart and Performance Metrics.

## Example Output
### Gantt Chart:
```
[P1: 0 - 4]
[P2: 4 - 9]
[P3: 9 - 12]
```
### Metrics:
```
Average Waiting Time: 3.67
Average Turnaround Time: 7.33
```
