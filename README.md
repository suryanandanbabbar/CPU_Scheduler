# Graphical User Interface(GUI)

## Overview
This branch introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating CPU scheduling algorithms. The interface allows users to input process details, select a scheduling algorithm, and visualize the execution order using a Gantt chart.

## Features
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with Java Swing.
- **Process Input Panel**: Users can add multiple processes dynamically.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Currently supports First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Priority Scheduling.
- **Results Display**: Shows Gantt chart, average waiting time, and turnaround time.

## Dependencies
- Java SE 8 or higher

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more scheduling algorithms (SJF, Round Robin, etc.)
- Enhance Gantt chart visualization with better UI components
- Implement real-time process execution simulation
